Bug 4524591 p2/s3 Compression utilities do not support by-reference mode

Implemented support for by-reference access to GeometryArray vertex
components in interleaved and non-interleaved formats, along with their
indexed variants, using both Java primitive arrays and NIO buffers.  No
support is provided for deprecated by-reference access to vertex
components in vecmath tuple arrays.

In this release all by-reference vertex components are actually copied
into existing compression stream elements for quantization and command
generation.  This leaves a significant memory optimization unexploited,
but in trying to go down that path it became clear that most of the
compression stream elements needed to be rewritten to do that.

The compressor has also been fixed to support initialIndexIndex,
validIndexCount, and useCoordIndexOnly for indexed geometry, along with
initialVertexIndex and validVertexCount for by-copy geometry.  These
attributes were all defined after J3D 1.1 when the compressor was
implemented.  The getModelBounds() and getNormalizedBounds() methods have
been added for RFE 4374633 since they were trivial to implement.
